Instructions for the installer:

At a high level, we bootstrap, clean and build quorum studio, and then run the 
script Run and Installer, in that order. Before any release, Installer.nsi 
should have its version numbers changed to account for new versions.

1. Do a fresh bootstrap into Quorum Studio
2. Open the project properties in Quorum Studio and press ok
3. Clean and build the plugins for Quorum Studio
4. Clean and build any dependencies for quorum studio (e.g., debugger jar)
5. Clean and Build Quorum Studio itself
6. Compile the script Run.nsi
7. Compile the script Installer.nsi
