Instructions for the installer (All Operating Systems):
1. Open quorum-language in Quorum Studio or above
2. Select RunLibrary as the main and run it
3. Right click quorum-language and copy the standard library to Quorum Studio
4. Reboot Quorum Studio
5. Open the Quorum Studio project and Clean and Build
6. Open the Quorum Debugger IntelliJ project and run the gradle script
7. Open the Quorum Studio IntelliJ project
8. If in Quorum Studio 3.0 or below, uncomment the JDK 11 and JDK 8 lines, swapping them, run gradle, then swap back to JDK 8. This ensures you have the right JDK in gradle. In Quorum Studio 3.5 or above, this does not matter.
9. Run the gradle script. To copy the JDK, run the copyBuild task, which must be done the first time.
10. Clean and Build Quorum Studio again. This has to be done a second time because the plugins need the dependencies
